Markup specification:
    everything functions like html tags

<math> opens a math environment that takes latex literals or tags, equivalent to "\begin{align*}" in latex
tags like <matrix> outside of a math tag should function like there's an implicit "$$" enclosing the matrix
<ilmath> creates inline math stuff (single dollar sign)

TODO: allow for implicit filling of matrix elements with 0 if not specified? for example:
	1
	0, 1
	0, 0, 1
	creates the 3x3 identity

<head> allows for defining of name, SID, homework number
by default, it will include all the random importing stuff in the template, but those fields should be settable

<prob name="name"> creates a new problem, i.e. "\subsection*{name}"
<part name="name"> creates a new part, inserint an enumerate tag if necessary and then adding "\item name"

all environments should treat strings like latex literals (except \< and \>, which need to be translated)

finally, the <pdf> tag includes the pdf at the specified URI, and the <img> tag does likewise for an image


USAGE:
    ./templater [--make [number]] [--compile [file]]
    Available commands:
        make: generates a template for a given homework number, from some json file somewhere
        compile: turns the template into a .tex
also have backticks represent alignment characters

probably put some configuration file/json somewhere


things that didn't show up in the example:
	- italics (<i></i>)
	- pdf inclusion
	- page breaks (<pbr>)
	- itemize, enumerate, and other lists
	- literal, for straight up evaluation
	- means of typing lt/lte, etc
