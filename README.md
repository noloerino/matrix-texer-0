Writing matrices in LaTeX is kind of annoying, and I personally find it
easier to just make a 2d-array in a Python script and then using a script
to convert that to LaTeX. To ease my suffering, I wrote a couple short
Python and Haskell scripts to convert arrays to LaTeX matrices, and also
to perform specified row operations on those matrices while outputting
the results of each intermediate step in LaTeX.

Well, it was useful during EE16A anyway.
